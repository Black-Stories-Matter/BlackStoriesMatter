# Black Stories Matter

## Project Goals and Requirements

- The goal was to showcase books by Black authors with a focus on children's literature. The audience is educators, families and youth. Black users can find “Mirrors”, stories they see themselves in. Other users visit for “Windows”, stories that give them a look into another experience.
- Users needed to be able to manipulate the data. My application displays book details from the API. Users can favorite books and filter by author.

## Wins
