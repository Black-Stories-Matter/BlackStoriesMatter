# Black Stories Matter 
The goal of Black Stories Matter is to showcase a database of children's books by Black authors. 
The audience is educators, families and youth. 
Black users can find “Mirrors”, stories they see themselves in. 
Other users visit for “Windows”, stories that give them a look into another experience.

## Future Iterations
We would like to continue adding books to the database and add more functionality to the front end user interface.
Please see the open source README if you are interested in contributing!
