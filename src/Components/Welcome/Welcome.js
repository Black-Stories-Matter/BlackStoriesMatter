      <h3>
        Our mission is to share books by Black authors where readers can find
        mirrors and windows.
      </h3>
      <h4>What are mirrors and windows in books?</h4>
      <p>
        Mirrors reflect a reader's own life. Seeing yourself, your family and
        your culture being valued in the world of a book provides a powerful
        sense of belonging.
      </p>
      <p>
        Books that are windows offer views into other experiences. Windows teach
        people to understand and appreciate differences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please support the Black authors you find here by buying their books,
        requesting them at libraries, or donating copies to schools and
        community centers!
